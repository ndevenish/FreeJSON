# FreeJSON - Simple JSON Library #

This is FreeJSON, a very simple objective-c based JSON library. I wanted to be
able to use JSON on older iOS devices than 5.0, but wanted to avoid as much
as possible the requirement for any attribution in the final product. For
this reason, it is Licenced under the '1-Clause' BSD licence, so attribution
is only required when distributing the source.

## Working State ##
There is a basic set of unit tests, testing the working state of each of the
parsers. I'm not claiming any robustness, but it works for my case of parsing
always-valid JSON data.
